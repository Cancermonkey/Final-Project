			<h2>
				Lion-O for President!
			</h2>
			<p>
				Lion-O has had enough of what has become "The Divided States of 
				Embarassment", and is here to bring us TOGETHER again! Away with 
				"Entitlements" and "Identity Politics", because we are ALL
				Americans! On a platform of "Equal opportunity for ALL", there 
				will be, for everyone, an equal opportunity for success, failure AND
				consequence. Smaller Government at the top, and more power and 
				freedoms at the State level. We will protect our borders and our assets
				, which is YOU! We will once angai be THE United States of America!
			</p>
		</section>
		<aside>
			<p>
				Lion-O is the leader of The Thundercats, and has beaten back
				the bad guy more times than you can count. He can, and will protect us all.
