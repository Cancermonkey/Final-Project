			Lion-O is a Thunderian male, with moderately-long, wavy, scarlet-red hair, and ginger-orange eyes. He is a fully-grown adult, with a thick, built, muscular physique. He has a heart-shaped hairline, and thick, wavy sideburns. His coat is caramel in color, with light cream-colored markings around his eyes, mouth, and on his arms. His face is very masculine, with a prominent brow, defined cheekbones, a cleft-chin, a chiseled jaw, and thick, choppy eyebrows. His eyes are large with thick lashes and black tear-drop marks on the lower-lids. Like most Thunderians, he has fangs, claws, and slit-pupils.
			
			Lion-O's primary outfit consists of an azure-blue armor, with blue lining along the shoulder-straps and abdominal-opening. The outfit is heavily exposed, but includes blue boots with white-lining, as well as a thick blue support-belt with white-lining, and the Eye of Thundera at the center; the belt also has three rounded-studs on each side of the Eye.

			When he arrived on Third Earth he was an adult. He did not have the chance to age naturally, thus he was a child in an adult's body. He was immature and headstrong. It took him a long while to mature. It was a very difficult process. 
			
			On Third Earth, much like his big-cat namesake, Lion-O had super strength, endurance, and agility. Very handsome, as described by Cheetara. He also had the cunning and skills of a fighter, but because of the time spent in his capsule, he missed the experiences needed in growing up. Now acknowledged as the heir to the throne of the ThunderCats, he wields Jaga's legendary Sword of Omens. Panthro and Tygra will serve as role models to Lion-O, especially in the first half of the First Season. Later on in the series, he will ask for some advice from Lynx-O, but his main mentor and guide will still be Jaga the Wise.
